# Bewildered
Bewildered is a front-end web application built with the AngularJS framework.
Bewildered is a puzzle, the user is presented with an encrypted string that they
must solve by figuring out what the original message was. Bewildered keeps track
of how many puzzles you have attempted, how many you have given up on, and how
many you have successfully completed; it also tracks the users best time.
